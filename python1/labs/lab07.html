:mod:`lab07_built_in_functions` -- Built-ins
===================================================

Reference the built-in functions on p.102 of the pocket reference

Create a new variable *my_var* and assign it a value. Set *my_var_2* = *my_var*

Is the id() of *my_var* the same as the id() of *my_var_2*?

Create a new tuple *my_tuple* of integers and print the result of running 
   sum() and max() on it

What function would return the length of *my_tuple*? Print the result

Print the length of the resulting object using set() on [2, 18, 77, 3, 2]

Use zip() and dict() to create a new dictionary from two tuples. The first tuple has the keys, the other has the values.

Create a function that takes 2 arguments and returns their product. Use map() with two iterables and the product function. Print the result.

Create a function that takes 1 integer argument and returns True if odd, else False. Use filter() and that function to consume a list of even and odd integers. Print the result.

Create a function that takes 2 arguments and returns twice their sum. Use  reduce() and that function on an iterable. Print the result.

What does locals() do and what data type is it? Print your locals()
