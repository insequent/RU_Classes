:mod:`lab04_bitwise` -- Bitwise Operations
==========================================

Create two binary numbers and print them.

Print the results of AND'ing, OR'ing, and XOR'ing the numbers together.
   Are the answers what you expect? What base are they?

Stretch goal: Figure out how to output the answer in binary
