:mod:`lab06_decorators` -- Python Decorators
=============================================

LAB06 Learning Objective: Familiarization with function decorators

Decorators are called with an argument of the underlying function. The decorator replaces the called function with another function (that usually calls the underlying function at some point).

#. Create a list with random first names including "Bob".

#. Write a function party() that takes a single list argument (invitees) and prints it.

#. Write a decorator named @bouncer for party(). Bouncer prints "Looking for Bob..."
   and removes anyone named Bob from the invitee list, then calls party() with the new list. Print "Dropping Bob..." if he is found. Include a one line docstring.

#. Call party(invitee_list) to test.

#. Add a call to inspect.getmembers() on the bouncer object. Print the resulting list of tuples skipping cases where the 2nd element of the tuple is a dictionary.
