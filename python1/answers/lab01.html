:mod:`lab01_identifiers_modules` -- Identifiers & Modules 
=========================================================
   
Write the identifier naming conventions for: 
   variables, constants, functions
   
What leading character is used to make a variable private?
   What are the two types of private variables?
   
.. note::

 We will be building a virtual lottery as a lab project.

Create new modules called lotto.py and lotto_drawing.py
and initialize the following constants in lotto.py:

 #. DRAWS_PER_YEAR = 104
 #. RANDOM_MIX = 20
 #. DEFAULT_NUM_BALLS = 54
 #. DEFAULT_YEARS = 1
 #. DEFAULT_NUM_PICKS = 6

Add a line:  
print "DRAWS_PER_YEAR is", DRAWS_PER_YEAR
   
Read the Ipython help on the *edit* and *run* magic commands.

Use *edit* or *run* to execute **lotto.py**. Correct any syntax errors.
