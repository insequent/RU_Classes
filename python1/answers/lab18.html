:mod:`lab18_file_processing` --- File Processing
================================================

#. Read about the open() built-in function on p.111 of the pocket reference book. 
   What is the default open mode?
   What exception can be raised if open() fails?
   What is a file object?
   What is the difference between binary and text mode access to a file?
   How are newlines handled on read? On write?
    
#. Read about File on p.45 of the pocket reference book.
   Name 5 functions exported by a file object

#. Create a file containing 5 lines in it in your current directory. Open the file in
    a *with* statement and use the read(), readline(), and readlines() functions.
   
#. Re-open the file for appending and use writelines() to add 2 lines, then use "print >>" and add lines "hi" and "there".

#. Print the file to verify your writes worked
