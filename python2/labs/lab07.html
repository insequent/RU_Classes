:mod:`lab07_threads` -- Threads
=========================================

LAB07 -- Learning Objective: Familiarization with threading module and 
         boss/worker pattern.
         Optional Objective: Use eventlet's greenthread instead.

::

 1. Read the doc for the threading module.

 2. Create a boss/worker model by threading the following functions: 

    a) boss(): generates random work using the (3) patent find functions from lab04, 
       then inserts the new work (as functions) in a data structure for worker 
       threads. Use a Condition variable to synchronize access to the work data structure.

    b) worker(): Run in daemon mode. Waits for an Event called *connections_avail_event*, 
       then obtains and saves a *connection* object from a dictionary using it's thread 
       id or name as the key. Use thread local storage to save connection object. 
       Removes work from the work data structure managed by boss thread when *notified*. 
       Executes the work item (a function). 

    c) OPTIONAL: connection_mgr(): Waits for an Event called *init_complete_event*, then 
       obtains and inserts a connection object for database access. The connection object
       can be any object i.e. can be simulated.

  3. Create mainline code to initialize at least 4 worker threads, the boss, and 
     connection_mgr threads. Test by generating at least 10 work items.
