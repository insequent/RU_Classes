================================================

Reference the Python Module Index at http://docs.python.org

What is the __future__ module for?

What is **random.choice()** and what does it do? 

What does the urllib2 module do? Is there a command in linux
   or Windows you can compare it to?

What does the **copy** module provide? What is a "memo" dictionary? 

What does the *shutil.copytree()* do?

Bonus:

Create a module called "test" with one function. In the "test" directory, 
    make another module named "subtest" with a single variable. Import both
    modules in a script and print the function result and variable.
