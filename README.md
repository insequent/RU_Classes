#RU Python Class Repository
*This is a work in progress!*

This repo is a reference point for legacy Python class materials, containing *many* edits by myself. Going forward, I'm in the process of converting all the material into Rackspace specific instructions while using iPython notebook as the medium.

#####NOTE: This is not official repo for RU classes, however a stage point for my own work.
