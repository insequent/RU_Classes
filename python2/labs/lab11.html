:mod:`lab09_patentDB_REST_server` -- REST server
=================================================

LAB08 Learning Objective: Familiarization with implementing a basic REST server
      Optional Objective: Use the framework of your choosing (Tornado, Twisted, Flask, etc.)

 #. Read the documentation for *bottle* web server micro framework at http://bottlepy.org

 #. Copy the patentDB_runner.py module from lab04 into a new module called patentDB_REST_server.py

 #. Modify patentDB_REST_server.py:

    #. Remove code that initializes and loads the database (keep the methods however)

    #. Convert into a *bottle* web app. Use host='0.0.0.0', port=80, debug=False, reloader=True on the run() method. You must be root 
       to start the server, so su root or login as root (same password as student). Note: use port 411XX to access your VM port 80, 
       where XX is your station number.

    #. Now we create a partial REST API to our database. Bind the PatentDB find_by_author() method to a GET request for '/patent/<last>'.
       Return a JSON payload containing a dictionary with keys "Results" and "Message". Return "Success" as the "Message" unless there 
       is an exception, in which case the exception message should be returned. "Results" should be a list

    #. Bind '/patent/form' to a GET that returns a form to enter author last, author first, and a patent number. Specify the action to
       invoke '/patent'

    #. Bind '/patent' to a POST that inserts a new patent with a zero filing date

    #. Remove any remaining unused code

 #. Test your new URLs and add yourself as a new patent holder
