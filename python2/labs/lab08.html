:mod:`lab08_multiprocessing` -- Multiprocessing
================================================

LAB08 Learning Objective: Use multiple processes and a Queue to synchronize
      work units for consumer.

::

  a. Ask for a directory to process (use raw_input())

  b. Create a multiprocessing.Queue for producer/consumer processes to use

  c. Find sub-directories in the given directory

  d. Producer side: 
     For each sub-directory, start a new multiprocessing.Process that walks 
     the sub-directory, recursively building a dictionary of regular files, 
     where the key is a SHA1 hash of the contents, and the value 
     is the full path name. If duplicate files are discovered, 
     print the paths.  When done, add the dictionary to the Queue.

  e. Consumer side:
     As directories become available on the Queue, merge them into a master 
     dictionary called *rollup_dict*. Once again, if duplicate files are discovered,
     print the paths.

  f. When all processes have finished (how can you tell?), report their pid
     numbers and exit codes. Also report the number of unique files in the given
     directory.
