:mod:`lab14_scope_binding` --- Scope and Binding
================================================

#. Create a new module called *my_scope.py*

#. Create a new variable in *my_scope* called *my_x* = 3

#. Create a new function in *my_scope* called *my_fun*
   that creates variable *my_x = 33* and returns it

#. In the mainline pre for *my_scope*, print the value
   of *my_x*, then call *my_fun* and print its return
   value. Are they the same? Why or why not?

#. Create a new function in *my_scope.py* called *deco* that accepts a single
   function argument, then defines and returns another function (i.e. def inside a def). 

#. Call *deco* within your mainline and send the builtin function globals() as an argument.
   Call *deco* again but send locals(). If globals() == locals() in mainline, why the difference?

#. Finally, call *deco* with *my_fun*
